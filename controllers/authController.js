  /*
     The promisify function in the 'util' module is a powerful tool for working with asynchronous JavaScript code in a more readable and manageable way. It allows you to convert functions that follow the traditional error-first callback style into functions that return Promises.

    The typical callback style in JavaScript involves passing a function as a callback to another function. The callback function is called when the asynchronous operation completes, receiving an error (if any) as the first argument and the result as the subsequent arguments. Here's an example of a function that follows the callback style:

    function readFile(path, callback) {
    // Asynchronous operation to read a file
    // ...
    if (error) {
      callback(error); // Error occurred, call the callback with the error
    } else {
      callback(null, data); // Operation completed successfully, call the callback with the data
    }
  }

    In line 114, the promisify function is used to convert the function, which follows the callback style, into a Promise-based function. Now, instead of passing a callback to readFile, you can call readFilePromise and handle the result using then and catch methods on the returned Promise.

    Using promisify, you can convert other asynchronous functions that follow the callback pattern into Promises, making it easier to work with asynchronous operations in JavaScript and allowing you to take advantage of features like async/await syntax for more readable code.

  /*
    A password reset token is a randomly generated unique code or token that is used to verify the identity of a user who wants to reset their password. It is a temporary credential provided to the user to authenticate their request for a password change or reset.

    When a user initiates a password reset process, typically by clicking on a "Forgot Password" link or button, the system generates a password reset token. This token is then sent to the user through a secure communication channel, such as email or SMS. The user is instructed to enter the token on a password reset page or provide it as part of the password reset flow.

    The password reset token serves two primary purposes:

    Identity verification: By requiring the user to provide the token, it ensures that the person attempting to reset the password is the legitimate owner of the account. It adds an extra layer of security and prevents unauthorized access to user accounts.

    Authorization and password reset: Once the user provides the correct token, they are granted temporary authorization to change their password. They are usually redirected to a password reset page where they can enter a new password of their choice.

    The password reset token is typically time-limited, meaning it has an expiration time. This ensures that the token is only valid for a specific duration, enhancing security by preventing its misuse if intercepted or obtained by unauthorized parties.

    It's worth noting that the exact implementation of password reset tokens may vary depending on the system or application. Some systems may use random strings as tokens, while others may encrypt or hash the token before sending it to the user. Additionally, additional security measures such as rate limiting or captcha challenges may be applied to protect against abuse or automated attacks.

  /*
    In Mongoose and Node.js, the decision to use await user.save() instead of User.findByIdAndUpdate() depends on the specific requirements and context of your application. Let's explore the differences between these two approaches:

    await user.save(): This approach is used when you have an existing user instance and you want to save any changes made to that instance. When you call user.save(), Mongoose will persist the changes to the database.

    User.findByIdAndUpdate(): This method is used when you want to update a document directly in the database without retrieving the document first. It is a convenient way to update a document based on its unique identifier (_id) without loading the entire document into memory.

    The choice between these two approaches depends on factors such as:

    a) Need for document validation: If your Mongoose schema has defined validation rules (e.g., required fields, data type constraints), calling await user.save() will trigger the validation process. If any validation errors occur, the save operation will fail, and you can handle the errors appropriately. On the other hand, User.findByIdAndUpdate() does not trigger validation by default, so you won't have the benefit of validation checks unless you explicitly enable them.

    b) Document-level operations: When you use await user.save(), you can perform additional operations on the user instance before saving it. For example, you can modify other fields, invoke instance methods, or apply middleware hooks defined in your schema. User.findByIdAndUpdate() does not provide the same level of flexibility since it operates at the database level, bypassing the Mongoose middleware and instance methods.

    c) Performance considerations: If you only need to update a specific field or a limited set of fields in a document, using User.findByIdAndUpdate() can be more efficient. It reduces the amount of data transfer between the application and the database by only sending the modified fields. In contrast, await user.save() will send the entire document, potentially causing more network overhead.

    In summary, if you have an existing user instance and want to save changes while leveraging document validation and additional operations, await user.save() is a suitable choice. However, if you only need to update specific fields and don't require document-level operations or validation, User.findByIdAndUpdate() can be more efficient. Consider your specific requirements and trade-offs to determine the appropriate approach in your application.
